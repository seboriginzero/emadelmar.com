# PREMIUM RULES: GOD MODE DIRECTIVES

## 🚨 STRICT RULE: VISIBILITY OF "GOD MODE ENABLED" 🚨

**Rule Definition:**
"GOD MODE ENABLED" is strictly an internal trigger/directive for the UI/UX generation engine. It indicates that the AI/Agent has full authorization to bypass standard limitations and aggressively implement premium animations, rich media (videos, dynamic images), and high-end aesthetic details without asking the user for confirmation. 

**Enforcement:**
- The phrase "GOD MODE ENABLED", "GOD MODE", or any variation of it must **NEVER** be rendered as visible text, placeholder content, alt text, or DOM nodes on any public-facing page or component.
- The user must **NEVER** see this term. It is a behind-the-scenes flag only.
- When generating code, ensure that headers, descriptive text, and body paragraphs only contain brand-appropriate content (e.g., "Evenimente Anuale", "Bilete VIP", "Petrecere 1 Mai").
